# About this VirtualKeyboard
 This project is a virtual keyboard that is controlled through hand gestures, leveraging advanced computer vision technologies. By utilizing a webcam, the system detects and interprets hand movements, allowing users to type on a virtual keyboard without physical contact.
##To use this virtual keyboard project, follow these steps:

Download the Files: Start by downloading the main.py file from the project repository.

Launch the Project: Open and run main.py using PyCharm. This action will activate your computer's webcam.

Webcam Setup: When the webcam is on, position yourself so that you're neither too close nor too far from the camera. This ensures optimal detection of your hand movements.

Using the Virtual Keyboard:

Finger Positioning: This virtual keyboard is designed to work with your index and middle fingers (landmarks 8 and 12).
Hovering: To hover over a keystroke and highlight it in dark purple, use only your index finger.
Typing: Bring your index and middle fingers together to simulate a key press. This action types in the selected key into either the keyboard's placeholder or an active Notepad file. The keystroke will turn green to indicate the action.
Notepad Functionality:

Default State: By default, the Notepad feature is deactivated. Initially, keystrokes are typed into a placeholder.
Activation: Clicking on the Notepad key will activate it, changing its color to grey. Once activated, your keystrokes will be typed into an active Notepad file.
Follow these instructions to successfully run and interact with the virtual keyboard project.
